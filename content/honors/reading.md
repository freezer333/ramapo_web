# TAS Honors 301 - Virtual Reality Research Reading List
The following are a sampling of research papers that have have heavily influenced (or are a result of) our work at Ramapo College in the field of 3D interaction.  They are a good starting point for getting a general understanding of what we do.

Please read these papers, and provide a short (a few sentances) written summary of the major conclusions from each paper.  

Please also provide a more in-depth discussion on one of these papers in particular.  Your in-depth discussion should not be a summary, it should be about how the paper **relates to work that you plan on doing**, either as part of our current project or some time in the future.  *Note, this doesn't mean your in-depth discussion needs to be on a paper concerned with navigation - you may find that the experimental design in one of these papers, while looking at another type of interaction task, is highly related to some of our goals.*

There is no specific due-date for these summaries, but you should begin working on them as soon as possible and have them done around the middle of the November.  I recommend that you read these articles in the order presented.
