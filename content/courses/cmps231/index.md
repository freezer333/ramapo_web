## Academic Integrity
Students are expected to read and understand Ramapo College’s Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found in the Ramapo College Catalog.  Members of the Ramapo College community are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic endeavors.  Students who are suspected of violating this policy will be referred to the Office of the Provost.### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY SPECIFIC TO THIS COURSE  For programming assignments (Homework Assignments), you may discuss ideas, however you may not allow others to see your source code or examine others’.  Sharing of source code is extremely easy to detect and is strictly prohibited.  IF SHARING OF SOURCE CODE IS SUSPECTED, INTENTIONAL OR OTHERWISE, BOTH PARTIES WILL IMMEDIATELY BE REFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST.
